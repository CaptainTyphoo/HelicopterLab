The purpose of the lab in TTK4135 was to control a model of an helicopter that consisted of an arm, counter weight and two propellers attached to electrical DC motors. This was to gain real world experience in using optimization theory and algorithms with control theory. The helicopter were going to be controlled by a optimal sequence of inputs which were derived from a linearised model. Then test this input by running it in a open-loop system and in a closed-loop system with and without a linear quadratic regulator(LQR).

The whole lab were conducted using Matlab and an extension of Matlab called QuaRC which is a hardware-in-the-loop software generating machinecode running on external hardware which controlled the helicopter.
